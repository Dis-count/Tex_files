### Reward is important.
* Avoid punishment's serious shortcomings.Such as the waste of resources.
* Budget-balanced can reverse the downward trend and promote cooperation.
## Methods
> 64 Students 20 Rounds of the repeated game among the same four players.

    CR1:  Standard PGG                --10 Rounds
    CR2:  PGG with endogenous reward  --10 Rounds

    RC1:  PGG with endogenous reward  --10 Rounds
    RC2:  Standard PGG                --10 Rounds
* Total tax $R=4\alpha(20-\bar{x})$   to be redistributed in the second stage of endogenous reward.   Set $\alpha=20\%$
* In the reward stage, each players has 30 points. So player i's expected payoff is $\pi_i(x,g)=0.8\times(20-x_i+1.6\bar{x})+g_i\cdot R/120$ in CR2 and RC1.
## Model of conditional cooperation
* Three categories: Conformist Cooperator Defector
* Conformist: a conditional cooperator who cooperate primarily depending on whether others are cooperating.
$x(t+1) = ax(t)+b(x'(t)-x(t))$
$x(t)$ represent contribution $\pi(t)$ represent payoff
Use $(x_0,a,b)$ to show the action characterizations of three categories.
Estimate $(x_0,a,b)$ for each type of individual by linear regression.
## Simulations
> start with a set of stylized parameter specifications $(x_0,a,b)$ for cooperators,conformists and defectors close to the estimations in Table2.
For a variety of group compositions and parameters $a$ and $b$, the group average contribution increaces over rounds in the reward PGG.  (Fig-A,B,C)
## Discussion
* The conditonal cooperation model is relatively simple.
* Consider the two-lag extension to the standard conditonal cooperation model.
* Future research: what happens if both reward and punishment options are simultaneously available each time after a round of the PGG?
